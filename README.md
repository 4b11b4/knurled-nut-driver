## Instructions for Printing and Use
See a [writeup](https://4b11b4.com/) (not completed yet) here.

## Features
* __alignment__: no need to align the two metal extensions
* __plastic__: if you have an accident, you will not scratch the module
* __inexpensive__: very little material, easily replaceable
* __parametric__: can be modified to multiple drill bit sizes
* __durable__: no small tips which can break off or become damaged
* __simple__: very easy to print, simple design which utilizes friction forces
* __useable with power tools__: it is generally recommended not to use any
  power tools for tightening these nuts, as over tightening may damage the
  jack.<br><br>
  However, due to the design, if used with a power tool, the chance of
  damaging your jack is lessened. When the nut is tightened, the design of the
  bit will simply cause it to slip. In this scenario, you may cause extra wear
  to the bit, but the jack will not be damaged.<br><br>
  Even more preferable is to use a small precision electric drill with an
  adjustable clutch to set the desired torque. You can see (and hear)  this
  in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a87VO5FZRd8).
