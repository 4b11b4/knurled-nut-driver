## Instructions for Printing and Use
See a [writeup](https://4b11b4.com/k2nd.html) here.

## Features
* __alignment__: no need to align the two metal extensions
* __plastic__: if you have an accident, you will not scratch the module
* __inexpensive__: very little material, easily replaceable
* __parametric__: can be modified to multiple drill bit sizes
* __durable__: no small tips which can break off or become damaged
* __simple__: very easy to print, simple design which uses friction forces
* __useable with power tools__: most people will warn you
  (generally) to never use
  power tools for tightening these nuts, as over tightening may damage the
  jack.

However, this design will not damage your jack
if used with a power tool.
When the nut is tightened, the design of the
bit will simply cause it to slip rather than over-torque the nut.
(note: of course, you can <b>still</b> overtorque by pressing down too hard
<br><br>
In this scenario, you may cause extra wear
to the bit, but the jack will not be damaged.<br><br>

Even more preferable is to use a small precision electric drill with an
adjustable clutch to set the desired torque. You can see (and hear) this
in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a87VO5FZRd8).
